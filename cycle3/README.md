# Cycle 3: Network Grapher
Mapping a network is cool but mgmt needs a visual and non tech-folks work in spreadsheets.
Might as well do all the things with a simple script. Then takes it a step further and scans open ports.
## Python modules
- networkx
- pandas
- mathplotlib
- nmap
## Future Work
- Incorporate nmap vulnerability scanning on hosts
- Incorporate nmap scanning in graphing capability
- Be "less noisy" =)
