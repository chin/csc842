# Cycle 3: Network Grapher
Mapping a network is cool but mgmt needs a visual and non tech-folks work in spreadsheets.
Might as well do all the things with a simple script. Then takes it a step further and scans open ports. Starting point from https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-networks-in-python-d70f4cbeb259
## Python modules
- networkx
- pandas
- mathplotlib
- nmap
## Future Work
- Make output pretty
- Make sure people don't run in coffee shops
- Incorporate nmap vulnerability scanning on hosts
- [X] Incorporate nmap scanning on hosts graphed
- Be "less noisy" =)
